# Music-Server
- In a Group of 2, we built a music server where we can listen to music on our own site deployed from mopidy.
- Because this project was done a few years ago, we lost the whole content. But we still have the slides if you want to take a look at
what we have done, to get it up and running.

# Hardware Needed
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+
- 64GB SD Card (Recommended)
- Raspbian as OS for LINUX, here is the site for it https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

# What did you use to have the music server running?
- You'll be using only the Terminal Command Line to get everything setup and running to display the actual web content

# How did you contribute
- Did all of the installation and display for the web content to make it work
- Partner only setup the Raspberry Pi

# Other content
- All steps are on the .ppt file you can look at how it was done
